* Make example implementation of getCacheTime in JavaDoc
* Add method to MyBaseRequest that returns a boolean indicating that the request can possible be cached (based on HTTP statuses alone)
* MyBaseRequest#getBody() needs updated JavaDoc and should show an example implementation (that creates a HttpParamList and returns it as string)
* Fix bug that prevents the same requests from being sent multiple times in some cases
* Implement/add public String[] MyRequest#getInvalidatedContent(), which should return the content-names of invalidated content
* Output request statistics when logging is enabled (time to resolve and size in KB / MB etc, nicely formatted)
* Modify MyRequestListener#onRequestResolved method signature to "final MyRequest request" instead of just
  "MyRequest request" to indicate that a jump to the UI thread is probably needed
* Implement a queuing mechanism that has to be explicitly enabled and disabled (for example when no connection is available)
  The entire queue should be processed once queuing is disabled again
