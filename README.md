MyJsonApi
=========

MyJsonApi is a Java library designed to make working with online Json Api's
extremely easy.

The library's goals are:

* Create an easy interface for communicating with a RESTful Json-Web-Api
* Persist callbacks / listeners across multiple instances of the same class
  (Android recreates instances when the device is rotated, for example)
* Built-in caching (that is only there when you need it)
* Abstract away all of the Java boilerplate code normally needed when doing
  (HTTP) networking I/O.
* Library usage is cleary visible while scanning source code (everything is
  prefixed with "My")
